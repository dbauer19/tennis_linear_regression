# tennis_linear_regression
Single, double, and multi feature linear regression models generated from ATP tennis player data. 
The models were generated to observe the relationship between various tennis statistics, such as aces and/or break point opportunities, and the success of a particular professional tennis player. The success of a player was measured in winnings (USD).
